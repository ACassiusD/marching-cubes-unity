# marching-cubes-unity
An implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm in Unity 3D
This algorithm samples 3d perlin noise values onto a 3d Grid representation. Using a isolevel we determine which verticies of the gridcell are considered terrain and which are considered air.
The marching cubes algorithm then marches through the cubes to calculate the mesh for each gridcell.
